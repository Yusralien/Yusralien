# 🧑‍💻 Welcome to Alienworm's profile 

**`Cybersecurity and Apps Development Enthusiast (Pentester/Developer/Flutter Developer)`**

I am a student of Mechanical Engineering, and I have also become an Information Technology enthusiast in a specific field. I am building my version of the digital world one step at a time. Perhaps, I can develop my skills as a freelancer, and maybe someday, I will become a developer as I have dreamed before.
